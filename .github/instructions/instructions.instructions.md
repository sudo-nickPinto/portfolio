There are still some problems i want to hash out.

Firstly: when user is prompted to begin, they should not have access to any other material within the website. This means only Nicholas Pinto and Begin button should be visible. The rest of the hero content (subtitle, elevator pitch) should be hidden until after the intro animation completes.

Second: the info animation is a little funky. There is an error in the weather and other box. The typing is a little weird too. Make it more appealing to human beings. 

After blowing up, the Nicholas Pinto letters should dynamically come back as if they are being placed by cranes into the correct position. The typing animation should be a little slower, and the weather/time/status should appear one after another, not all at once. The weather box should be more to the right and formatted better (placed better). Within the text box, the boxes themslves should not be moving or auto-wrapping when the text isd being typed. 

Also change fonts for everything to make it more appealing and tech savvy.

After 10 idle seconds, a pop up should appear asking if user wants to play a game to unlock more information about Nicholas Pinto with the computer (tic/tac/toe). If user wins, a fun fact should be pulled from the array of fun facts (given later). The user has an exit button if they want to exit tic tac toe and return back to normal website (think of it like an easter egg)

When going into tic tac toe, everything in forground should go black, and the tic tac toe game should appear in high resolution.. Exit button should be in top right corner.
