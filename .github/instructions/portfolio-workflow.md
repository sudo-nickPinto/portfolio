## Overview
Based on the analysis of https://bepatrickdavid.com/, this workflow will guide you through creating a clean, professional, and well-organized portfolio that follows proven design patterns.

## Key Design Elements Observed

### 1. Overall Structure & Organization

1. **Hero Section**

Nicholas Pinto — Aspiring Software Engineer
Exploring coding projects in [Current Location] | [Day, Time] · [Weather]

Aspiring software engineer with a passion for building creative, practical solutions. Currently developing academic and personal projects that combine computer science with music and other disciplines, while continuously learning new tools and approaches.

2. **About Section**

I am an aspiring software engineer and undergraduate student seeking my first software engineering internship. My academic projects have introduced me to full-stack development, Python scripting, Java applications, and Swift for iOS development. At Gettysburg, I am pursuing a course cluster project in which I’m developing a machine learning model that analyzes sheet music and audio to generate backing tracks for guitar performance—an effort that combines my technical skills with my passion for music.

Beyond the classroom, I bring leadership and organizational experience. As Vice President of my hometown EMS organization, I coordinated emergency response operations and oversaw team logistics. On campus, I work as a Resident Assistant and participate in my fraternity, which have strengthened my abilities in communication, teamwork, and mentorship.

I am eager to contribute to a development team where I can apply my skills in Java, Python, Swift, and JavaScript, while gaining real-world experience in software engineering, backend systems, or AI applications. My goal is to grow as a developer while making meaningful contributions to impactful projects.

3. **Build section by section** - Don't try to do everything at once
4. **Test frequently** - Use Live Preview to see changes in real-time
5. **Get feedback** - Share with others for input on design and content

Remember: A great portfolio tells a story about who you are as a professional. Focus on clarity, organization, and showcasing your best work in a way that's easy for visitors to understand and navigate.




More TODO: 

This is good for now, but needs to be very minimalistic, kind of like apple website, but also more like the patrick david patrick bateman collab, on a much more advanced level of css.


Some ideas to implement. Before doing so, clarifiy any questions:

Black screen should animatively go into a screen where Nicholas in all white comes from the top and Pinto from the Bottom in large font. 

The black background should then open up into a picture of the Great Wave of Kanagawa (asserts/images Great Wave of Kanagawa) .

 Then the small brief about me should go to the right while Nicholas Pinto goes to the right. 
 
 Does this make sense? What is the best way to implement something like this.

When it gets to this screen after the opening animation, i want white text to appear typing Gettysburg, PA (location logo next to it), the time in Gettysburg, and the current weather in Gettysburg.

 If between the hours of 11:00p-7:00a, "What I'm up to?" should be "Sleeping"
 If between the hours of 7:00a-5:00p,, "What I'm up to?" should be a mix of "Developing", "Coding", "Learning", "Having Fun"
If between the hours of 5:00p-11:00p, "What I'm up to?" should be "Relaxing"

Top left corner should be Nicholas Pinto in a bold, elegant font, next to it "Aspiring Developer". On the right top, should be the nav section of about, expierience, contact.

Should interasctively scroll.

When going to about section from home/main page, have the image of the Great Wave seemlessely transistion into another photo of Saint Nicholas provided (assests/images/Saint Nicholas.jpg). 

And have the full about me there. 

The picutre of saint Nick should be on the right, and about me on the left. When a cursor hovers over the picture (should take up half the page) A message "I am not this Nick" with a creative styling to show that is Saint Nicholas
