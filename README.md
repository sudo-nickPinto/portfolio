# Portfolio - Starter Site

This repository contains a fully-commented, static portfolio starter built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The goal is to provide a clear, well-documented codebase you can learn from and teach others.

## Quick start (serve locally)

If you have Python installed you can start a simple HTTP server from the project root:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Project structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with semantic sections
- `css/main.css` - Stylesheet with comments and responsive rules
- `js/index.js` - Vanilla JS for interactivity (smooth scrolling, modal)
- `docs/` - Per-file documentation (created next)

## Next steps
1. Fill in your real content and project images
2. Tweak styles and layout in `css/main.css`
3. Add more JS interactions in `js/index.js`
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel when ready
